# My Emacs Configuration files

My configuration uses both .emacs and org-mode to work properly. At first glance, it seemed necessary in order to have ligatures working on Windows. Moreover, the .org file is just a modified file from my mentor's configuration file.

In .emacs, there are a few tweaks, such as initial window configuration, window/focus control shorcuts and the keycasting configuration, which is a frankenstein. In order to make this package work in the active window, I've downloaded the moody package and, in order to change the typing casting, I've used part of someone elses configuration, which I found in GitLab. I found the owner of it in a tutorial video teaching how to use magit and I really like being able to see which commands he was using, since I'm a beginner in Emacs. Also, I've changed the original color of the shortcut cast in the mode line bar myself and I re-compiled this package (keycast). I'm not providing this modification in this repo, and probably will cause some errors without the moody package.

Probably this configuration will change in the future, depending on the operating system and my mood with this really stressful tool, called Emacs.
